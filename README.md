This jupyter notebook illustrates implementing Grover's algorithm to solve 3 by 3 and 4 by 4 sudokus in qiskit.

## Essence of Grover's algorithm

Grover's algorithm is a quantum algorithm that can be used to perform unstructured search. Suppose we have a desired winner state *w*. Then we begin with initial state *s*. Grover's algorithm consists of amplitude reflection and amplification. Let *s'* be an arbitary state in which is orhtonormal to the state *s*. We first reflect *s* with respect to *s'*. Then we perform additional reflection with respec to *s* this time. Then, we will obtain a state closer to *w*. By repeating this operation multiple times we will obtain a state that is almost identical to state *w*.
